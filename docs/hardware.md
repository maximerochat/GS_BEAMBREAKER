# Phase shifter 
On of the most important component to achieve beam steering is the phase shifter since 
it is this tiny component that can control out phase shift to direct the beam. The most challenging part
is to find one that suits our need and that is not to expensive. 

There seems to be really good product from Analog Devices but they are to expensive for my project at this time, that's why 
i would choose (for my first iterations at least) an alternative, the [PS214-315](https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/medias/docus/581/PS214-315.pdf).

The main drawback of this product is that it as only a shift range on ~100Â° at 2.4GHz which means we won't be able to fully steer the beam as we wish,
but it is certainly sufficient for the beginning.
