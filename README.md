# GS_BEAMBREAKER
This project is a first iteration of 2.4GHz FSK signal beam steering

I'll try do document this project along it's advancement.

# Goal of this project 
I'm not a professional RF designer, just an enthusiastic Computer Science student trying to understand the complexity of beam forming. Since I had trouble finding guide about basic beam forming hardware and software, I'm trying to produce good material for future person like me. If you are interested in collaborating or want to correct me and point out mistakes I'm made, feel free to contact me or to raise issues.
