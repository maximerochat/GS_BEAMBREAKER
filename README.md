# GS_BEAMBREAKER
This project is a first iteration of 2.4GHz FSK signal beam steering

I'll try do document this project along it's advancement.

# Goal of this project 
I'm not a professional RF designer, just an enthusiastic Computer Science student trying to understand the complexity of beam forming. Since I had trouble finding guide about basic beam forming hardware and software, I'm trying to produce good material for future person like me. If you are interested in collaborating or want to correct me and point out mistakes I'm made, feel free to contact me or to raise issues.

# Notice
I am currently only working on the physics and thinking of the project, I'll try do documentate everything along my research. This means that the current hardware template is not accurate, it's juste a basic implementation of a SX1280 radio (I didn't tested it for the moment, I'm about to produce it in a few weeks). The hardware for this project I hope will be built during the next academic semester, I'll try to contact some labs in my university (EPFL) to see if they can help me in my jounrey
